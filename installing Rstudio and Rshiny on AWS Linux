Step by Step installation of RStudio and RShiny Server on AWS Linux2 Machine
Step 1 VPC Setup:
Creation of the VPC using the wizard and the public subnet is good for this task.
Step 2: Create your RStudio Server host
Create a public instance using your created VPC in step 1 and Public Subnet created and configure the SECURITY GROUP to use the following configurations:
-	SSH from everywhere (or from your own IP address)
-	Custom TCP Rule from everywhere with the port range 8787 (Rstudio Port)
-	Custom TCP Rule from everywhere with the port range 3838 (Rshiny Port)

Step3:  Install RStudio and Rshiny
I strongly recommend you do the installation using the system administrator(root)
Install R using the following command:
Sudo amazon-linux-extras install R3.4
then chose ‘y’ to continue installation
Step 4: Install RStudio
Install RStudio Server
wget https://download3.rstudio.org/centos5.9/x86_64/shiny-server-1.5.4.869-rh5-x86_64.rpm
yum install -y --nogpgcheck shiny-server-1.5.4.869-rh5-x86_64.rpm
Step 5: Install RShiny
#install shiny and shiny-server (2017-08-25)
wget https://download3.rstudio.org/centos5.9/x86_64/shiny-server-1.5.4.869-rh5-x86_64.rpm
yum install -y --nogpgcheck shiny-server-1.5.4.869-rh5-x86_64.rpm
rm shiny-server-1.5.4.869-rh5-x86_64.rpm

you can verify your installation with this command
sudo rstudio-server verify-installation
Add a username with the following command 
 Sudo useradd username
 Sudo username: password | chpasswd 
Copy the Public DNS of your instance and paste on the browser :8787 for Rstudio
